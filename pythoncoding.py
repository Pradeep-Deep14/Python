#index slicing
#Here's a step-by-step explanation of what's happening:

#1. `a = [2, 5, 3, 4]`: This line initializes a list `a` with the elements `[2, 5, 3, 4]`.

#2. `a[2:2] = [2]`: In this line, slice assignment is used to insert an element `[2]` into the list `a`. Let's break it down:
   #ðŸ‘‰ `a[2:2]`: This is a slice notation that specifies a range from index `2` to index `2`, which effectively represents an empty slice. It doesn't include any elements.
   #ðŸ‘‰ `= [2]`: On the right-hand side, you have a list `[2]` containing the element `2`.

   #So, the code is essentially saying, "Replace the empty slice from index `2` to index `2` in the list `a` with the element `[2]`."

#3. After the slice assignment, the list `a` is modified to `[2, 5, 2, 3, 4]`. The element `2` is inserted at index `2`, shifting the existing elements to the right.

#4. `print(a)`: Finally, this line prints the contents of the modified list `a`.

#The output of the code is: [2, 5, 2, 3, 4]

#So, the code successfully inserts the element `2` into the list `a` at the specified position, resulting in the updated list `[2, 5, 2, 3, 4]`.
